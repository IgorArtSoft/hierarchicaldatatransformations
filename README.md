This project includes source code files for custom sorting of XML files.
It should be extended to include other hierarchial data format transformations such as HTML & JSON.


Version 1 Notes:

There is an example of Jasper Reports template files transformation to address AODA WCAG logical reading order issue.
Some organizations only concern with HTML portion of AODA compliance, but it's not enough.
People, who can't read online reports, need to convey a meaning of PDF online report by hearing the content.
It's critically important that the information from PDF report must be in logical reading order.
To archive that existing Jasper Report files need to be restructured.
i.e. xml elements should be reallocated within jrxml file, that they follow customized logical order.

JasperReportsTransformator class does complex XML transformations of specific jasper jrxml files.
It generates new jrxml file with custom order. 
It also does complex validations, to make sure that content of new and original version of jrxml file is the same.

So JasperReportsTransformator makes one step ahead to addresses PDF AODA compliance for online reports, dynamically generated by JEE web applications.

Project uses Java 8.
